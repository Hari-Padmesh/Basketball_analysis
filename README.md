### Step-by-Step Description

1. **Frame Extraction** – OpenCV reads the input video and returns a list of BGR frames.

2. **Player Tracking** – A fine-tuned YOLOv8 model detects players; SuperVision's *ByteTrack* assigns persistent IDs across frames. Detections are processed in batches of 20 frames.

3. **Ball Tracking** – A separate YOLOv8 model detects the basketball. The highest-confidence detection per frame is kept. Wrong detections (ball suddenly appearing far from its previous position) are removed and the remaining gaps are filled by linear interpolation using Pandas.

4. **Court Keypoint Detection** – A YOLOv8 Pose model detects 18 pre-defined court landmark points (corners, free-throw lines, mid-court, etc.) per frame, also in batches of 20.

5. **Keypoint Validation** – Proportional-distance checks filter out hallucinated keypoints (80 % error margin).

6. **Team Assignment** – For every player bounding box, a cropped player image is passed to [Fashion-CLIP](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip) (`patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip`). The model scores the image against text prompts such as `"white shirt"` and `"dark red shirt"` to determine team membership. The assignment is refreshed every 50 frames.

7. **Ball Possession / Acquisition Detection** – For each frame the system finds which player is closest to the ball (or whose bounding box contains the most of the ball). A player must hold possession for at least 10 consecutive frames before it is confirmed.

8. **Pass & Interception Detection** – Possession transfers between players of the *same* team are counted as **passes**; transfers between players of *different* teams are counted as **interceptions**.

9. **Tactical View Conversion** – The 18 detected court keypoints are matched against known real-world court coordinates. OpenCV's `findHomography` (RANSAC) computes a perspective-transform matrix. A consistency check between candidate and previous homography prevents sudden mirrored flips. Player foot positions are projected into the 300 × 161-pixel tactical canvas.

10. **Speed & Distance Calculation** – Tactical pixel positions are scaled to real-world metres (28 m × 15 m court). Per-frame distances are accumulated for cumulative distance; a rolling 5-frame window is used to estimate speed in km/h.

11. **Drawing & Annotation** – A set of dedicated `Drawer` classes renders:
    - Coloured ellipses and team colours under each player
    - A triangle indicator over the ball-holder
    - Court keypoints
    - Team ball-control percentage bar
    - Pass / interception event labels
    - Per-player speed and cumulative distance
    - Minimap (tactical view overlay) in the top-left corner
    - Frame counter

12. **Video Export** – Annotated frames are written to an AVI file using OpenCV's `VideoWriter` (XVID codec, 24 fps).

### Key Technologies

| [Supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision) | ≥ 0.18 | ByteTrack multi-object tracker, detection helpers |

### Stub / Cache System

Heavy inference passes (player tracking, ball tracking, keypoint detection, team assignment) can be **cached to disk** as pickle files (`stubs/` directory). On subsequent runs the system reads from the stub if the frame count matches, skipping the expensive forward pass entirely.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 – 3.11** (recommended)
- **CUDA-capable GPU** (strongly recommended for real-time-ish processing; CPU-only is supported but slow)
- **FFmpeg** (optional, for playing back the output AVI)

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hari-Padmesh/Basketball_analysis.git
cd Basketball_analysis
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **GPU users:** Make sure you install the CUDA-compatible version of PyTorch **before** running the command above, or replace the torch lines in `requirements.txt` with the wheel from [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### 4. Download model weights

Place the three YOLO model files in a `models/` directory at the project root:

```
models/
├── player_detector.pt
├── ball_detector_model.pt
└── court_keypoint_detector.pt
```

The Fashion-CLIP model (`patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip`) is downloaded automatically from the HuggingFace Hub on first run.

### 5. Add an input video

Copy your basketball game video into the `input_videos/` directory:

```
input_videos/
└── your_game.mp4
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic run

```bash
python main.py input_videos/your_game.mp4
```

### Custom output path

```bash
python main.py input_videos/your_game.mp4 --output_video output_videos/annotated_game.avi
```

### Custom stub directory

```bash
python main.py input_videos/your_game.mp4 --stub_path stubs/
```

### All options

```
usage: main.py [-h] [--output_video OUTPUT_VIDEO] [--stub_path STUB_PATH] input_video

Basketball Video Analysis

positional arguments:
  input_video           Path to input video file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_video        Path to output video file (default: output_videos/output_video.avi)
  --stub_path           Path to stub directory (default: stubs)
```

### First run vs. subsequent runs

- **First run:** All detectors run inference and cache their results to `stubs/`. This may take several minutes depending on video length and hardware.
- **Subsequent runs:** The stubs are reused automatically, making reruns very fast.

To force re-inference (e.g., after changing a model), delete the relevant `.pkl` files in `stubs/`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `configs/configs.py` to change default paths:

```python
STUBS_DEFAULT_PATH = 'stubs'
PLAYER_DETECTOR_PATH = 'models/player_detector.pt'
BALL_DETECTOR_PATH = 'models/ball_detector_model.pt'
COURT_KEYPOINT_DETECTOR_PATH = 'models/court_keypoint_detector.pt'
OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH = 'output_videos/output_video.avi'
```

To customise **team jersey descriptions** for a different game, pass arguments to `TeamAssigner`:

```python
team_assigner = TeamAssigner(
    team_1_class_name="white shirt",
    team_2_class_name="dark red shirt"
)
```

---

## 🎯 Models

### Training your own models

Training notebooks are provided in `training_notebooks/`:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `basketball_player_detection_training.ipynb` | Fine-tune YOLOv8 for player detection |
| `basketball_ball_detection_training.ipynb` | Fine-tune YOLOv8 for ball detection |
| `model_dataset_eda.ipynb` | Exploratory data analysis of training datasets |

Refer to `Documentation/Ablation_Studies_Hyperparameter_Tuning.md` for hyperparameter tuning results and ablation study findings.

### Court Keypoints Layout

The system uses **18 court keypoints** mapped to real-world NBA/FIBA dimensions (28 m × 15 m):

```
Left edge (6 pts) → Mid-court (2 pts) → Left free-throw line (2 pts)
Right edge (6 pts) → Right free-throw line (2 pts)
```

---

## 📊 Output

The pipeline produces a single annotated video (`output_videos/output_video.avi`) containing:

- **Coloured ellipses** under each player (team colour coded)
- **Red triangle** above the player with ball possession
- **Team ball-control percentage** overlay (bottom-right)
- **Pass / interception** event labels
- **Speed (km/h) and distance (m)** displayed below each player
- **Tactical minimap** (top-left corner) showing a bird's-eye view of player positions on the court
- **Frame number** counter
